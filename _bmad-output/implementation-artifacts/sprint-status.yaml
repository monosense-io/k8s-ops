# DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS (2025-12-31):
# =================================
# Epic 5 Stories 5.3-5.5 have dependencies on Epic 6 and Epic 7:
#   - Story 5.3 (Deploy Business Apps) needs VolSync backups (Epic 7)
#   - Story 5.4 (Multi-Cluster Validation) needs VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs (Epic 6)
#   - Story 5.5 (Document Lifecycle) depends on validation patterns from 5.4
#
# CORRECT EXECUTION ORDER:
#   1. Epic 0-4: Foundation (no cross-dependencies)
#   2. Epic 5.1-5.2: Bootstrap apps cluster, staged rollout (independent)
#   3. Epic 6: Centralized Observability (needed for cross-cluster validation)
#   4. Epic 7: Backup & Disaster Recovery (needed for stateful app deployment)
#   5. Epic 5.3-5.5: Deploy apps with backups, validate with observability
#   6. Epic 8: ArsipQ Development Platform
